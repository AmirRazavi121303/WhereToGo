#obj_ID = Object Identifier, the unique value that identifies the object in the image catalog used by the CAS
#alpha = Right Ascension angle (at J2000 epoch)
#delta = Declination angle (at J2000 epoch)
#u = Ultraviolet filter in the photometric system
#g = Green filter in the photometric system
#r = Red filter in the photometric system
#i = Near Infrared filter in the photometric system
#z = Infrared filter in the photometric system
#run_ID = Run Number used to identify the specific scan
#rereun_ID = Rerun Number to specify how the image was processed
#cam_col = Camera column to identify the scanline within the run
#field_ID = Field number to identify each field
#spec_obj_ID = Unique ID used for optical spectroscopic objects (this means that 2 different observations with the same spec_obj_ID must share the output class)
#class = object class (galaxy, star or quasar object)
#redshift = redshift value based on the increase in wavelength
#plate = plate ID, identifies each plate in SDSS
#MJD = Modified Julian Date, used to indicate when a given piece of SDSS data was taken
